**Mario.c** 

Mario.c is a program that recreates this half-pyramid using hashes (#) for blocks. 
Prompt the user for the half-pyramid’s height, a non-negative integer no greater than 23.
Then generate (with the help of `printf` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.


**Greedy.c**

Greedy.c is a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made.
Use `GetFloat` from the CS50 Library to get the user’s input and printf from the Standard I/O library to output your answer. 
Assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).
